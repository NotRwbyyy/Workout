# Workout
To be more diligent with my time and not slack off when it comes to going to the gym.. I decided to create a script that runs as soon as my PC boots on and tells me what muscle group I'm going to be hitting for the day 
If you have any input on how to better make the code, i'd greatly appreciate it. 

I am not the best with HTML, so I watched a basic tutorial on how to create the HTML page
